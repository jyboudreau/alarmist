Usage: alarmist-job [options] <name> <command> [<arg>...]

Start a job. The working directory should match the
working directory of the monitor and usually this will
be the default. If the job is started via a watcher started
by the monitor then the 'ALARMIST_WORKING_DIRECTORY' environment
variable will have already been set.

A job can also be flagged as a service. Services are processes
that are not supposed to exit. As such they will be shown as OK
as long as they are running and error if they exit. The main
use case is to capture the logs from a long running process, such
as a web server, separately.

<name>: The name of the job
<command>: The command to start the job
<arg>: arguments for the command

Environment Variables:

${FORCE_COLOR_VAR}
${WORKING_DIRECTORY_VAR}
${SERVICE_VAR}

Options:
`;
export const MONITOR_USAGE_TEXT = `
Usage: alarmist-monitor [options] <command> [<arg>...]

Start monitoring jobs. If multiple monitors need to be run
in the same directory then use the '--working-dir' option
or export the 'ALARMIST_WORKING_DIRECTORY' variable to keep
them separated. This will also export the
'ALARMIST_WORKING_DIRECTORY' environment variable for use by
jobs started by the watcher tasks.

Environment Variables:

${FORCE_COLOR_VAR}
${WORKING_DIRECTORY_VAR}
${RESET_VAR}

<command>: The command to start the watcher tasks
